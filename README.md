This repository introduces the research dedicated to build intelligent multimodal assistants for medical purposes. In the experimental implementation of the bot we use logistic regression and simple word embeddings models. Current implementation shows the ability to combine empathic conversation with AI (without a specific goal) and functionality (satisfying the conceptual intent of the user) in order to maintain the patient's motivation to use such applications for a quick and useful response from the clinic. 

This development will be used to interact with respondents. Thus we are planning to develop a universal chatbot for health monitoring and routine communication with patients based on insights received from users.

The project is supported by the [e-Government Center](egov.itmo.ru) (ITMO University).
